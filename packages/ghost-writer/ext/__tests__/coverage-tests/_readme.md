# Extension Coverage Tests

This directory contains tests specifically for achieving high code coverage in the extension package.

## Test Strategy

- **Coverage Focus**: Tests designed to cover all code paths
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error paths
- **Adapter Coverage**: Ensure all adapter methods are tested
- **Command Coverage**: Test all command execution paths

## Test Structure

- `adapters.coverage.test.ts` - Coverage tests for VSCode adapters
- `commands.coverage.test.ts` - Coverage tests for command handlers
- `extension.coverage.test.ts` - Coverage tests for extension entry point
