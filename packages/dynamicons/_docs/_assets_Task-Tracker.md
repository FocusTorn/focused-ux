## **Pending Tasks**

### High Priority

#### (Core Functionality)

- [ ] **Implement dynamic path resolution**:
    - [ ] Replace hardcoded paths with robust path resolution that works across different environments using asset.constants.ts
        - [ ] Create path resolution utility that detects package directory dynamically
        - [ ] Update ThemeProcessor to use dynamic path resolution
        - [ ] Update ModelAuditProcessor to use dynamic path resolution
        - [ ] Update ThemeAuditProcessor to use dynamic path resolution
        - [ ] Test path resolution across different execution contexts (CLI, Nx, direct execution)

### **Medium Priority**

#### **Testing Coverage Improvements**

- [ ] **Individual Processor Testing**: While we have comprehensive integration tests, individual processor functionality could benefit from more granular testing:
    - [ ] **ModelAuditProcessor**: Test individual audit methods (auditModels, calculateTotalErrors, displayStructuredErrors)
    - [ ] **ThemeAuditProcessor**: Test individual audit methods (loadModelData, auditThemes, validateInverseMappings)
    - [ ] **PreviewProcessor**: Test individual methods (checkIfPreviewGenerationNeeded, generatePreviews, cleanupTempFiles)
    - [ ] **ThemeProcessor**: Test individual methods (checkIfThemeGenerationNeeded, deleteExistingThemes, generateThemes)
    - [ ] **IconProcessor**: Test individual methods (stageIconsFromExternalSource, organizeAndOptimizeIcons)

- [ ] **CLI Command Testing** (Affected by recent CLI testing work): Test individual CLI commands and their specific behaviors:
    - [ ] Test `--demo` flag functionality for audit processors
    - [ ] Test `--very-verbose` vs `--verbose` flag differences
    - [ ] Test error handling for invalid processor names
    - [ ] Test working directory management in CLI execution
    - [ ] Test process exit codes for success/failure scenarios
    - [ ] Test CLI argument parsing and validation
    - [ ] Test CLI help output and formatting
    - [ ] Test CLI integration with orchestrator

- [ ] **Edge Case Testing**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios:
    - [ ] Test behavior when external source directory is empty
    - [ ] Test behavior when model files are corrupted or malformed
    - [ ] Test behavior when theme files are locked or read-only
    - [ ] Test behavior when preview generation fails due to missing dependencies (Puppeteer/Sharp)
    - [ ] Test behavior when file system operations fail (permissions, disk space)

### **Low Priority**

#### **Performance Testing and Monitoring**

- [ ] **Performance Benchmarking and Monitoring**: Add comprehensive performance testing and tracking:
    - [ ] Test processing time with large icon sets (100+ icons)
    - [ ] Test memory usage during intensive operations
    - [ ] Test concurrent processing capabilities
    - [ ] Benchmark SVGO optimization performance
    - [ ] Add timing metrics for each processor execution
    - [ ] Implement performance tracking for asset generation steps
    - [ ] Add large-scale processing capabilities and stress testing
    - [ ] Implement resource usage tracking and optimization
    - [ ] Create performance monitoring dashboard or reporting

## **Future Enhancement Suggestions**

This section consolidates all enhancement suggestions from individual entries. When new enhancements are proposed in future entries, add them here if unique, or add sub-bullets to existing items if they expand on current suggestions.

**Note**: Tasks that are even minorly affected by current work should be moved to Current/Pending sections with detailed sub-bullets. Tasks should exist in either Current/Pending OR Future Enhancements, but not both.

- **Considered and deemed unnecessary**:
    - **Asset Versioning**: Versioning system to support rollback and comparison is not needed as any errors causing a critical failure need to be remediated and assets regenerated.
    - **Rollback Logic**: Implement rollback behavior for partial failures as documented in execution flow scenarios
    - **Change Detection**: ✅ **ALREADY OPTIMIZED** - The original orchestrator already implements sophisticated change detection (checkIconChanges, checkModelChanges, checkThemeFilesMissing, checkPreviewImagesMissing) that only runs processors when needed
    - **Nx Caching Leverage**: ❌ **NOT A VALUE-ADD** - Nx caching approach abandoned as it doesn't provide benefits over the existing orchestrator. The orchestrator already has better change detection than Nx can provide for external files outside the workspace

- **Performance Enhancements**:
    - **Parallel Processing**: Implement concurrent processing of independent asset types (icons, themes, previews) for faster execution
    - **Batch Processing**: Support batch processing of multiple asset sets or configurations
    - **Large-Scale Processing**: Add capabilities for processing large icon sets (1000+ icons) efficiently

- **Asset Optimization**:
    - **Advanced Optimization**: Add more sophisticated optimization strategies beyond SVGO (WebP conversion, responsive variants)
    - **Format Support**: Add support for additional image formats and conversion options

- **Error Recovery**:
    - **Comprehensive Error Recovery**: Implement comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
    - **Automatic Retry Logic**: Add automatic retry logic for transient failures
    - **Graceful Degradation**: Implement graceful degradation for partial failures
