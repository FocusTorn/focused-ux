# Dynamicons Core Coverage Tests

## Overview

Coverage tests for the `@fux/dynamicons-core` package generate and analyze test coverage reports to ensure comprehensive testing of all code paths. These tests help identify untested code and maintain high coverage standards.

## Coverage Configuration

### **Coverage Settings**

- **Provider**: `v8` (V8's built-in coverage provider)
- **Reporter**: `html`, `text`, `json`
- **Threshold**: 90% minimum coverage
- **Exclude**: Test files, configuration files, type definitions

### **Coverage Targets**

- **Statements**: 90% minimum
- **Branches**: 90% minimum
- **Functions**: 90% minimum
- **Lines**: 90% minimum

## Coverage Reports

### **HTML Report**

- **Location**: `coverage/index.html`
- **Purpose**: Interactive coverage visualization
- **Features**: File-by-file coverage analysis
- **Usage**: Open in browser for detailed coverage review

### **Text Report**

- **Location**: Console output
- **Purpose**: Quick coverage summary
- **Features**: Overall coverage percentages
- **Usage**: Review during test execution

### **JSON Report**

- **Location**: `coverage/coverage.json`
- **Purpose**: Programmatic coverage analysis
- **Features**: Detailed coverage data
- **Usage**: CI/CD integration and reporting

## Coverage Analysis

### **File Coverage**

```typescript
// Example coverage analysis
const coverageData = {
    'src/services/DynamiconService.ts': {
        statements: 95,
        branches: 92,
        functions: 100,
        lines: 95,
    },
    'src/utils/iconUtils.ts': {
        statements: 88,
        branches: 85,
        functions: 100,
        lines: 88,
    },
}
```

### **Coverage Categories**

#### **High Coverage (90%+)**

- Core business logic services
- Critical utility functions
- Error handling paths
- Integration points

#### **Medium Coverage (70-89%)**

- Helper functions
- Optional features
- Edge case handling
- Configuration utilities

#### **Low Coverage (<70%)**

- Deprecated code
- Unused utilities
- Debug code
- Experimental features

## Coverage Goals

### **Critical Paths (100%)**

- **Service Methods**: All public service methods
- **Error Handling**: All error paths and exception handling
- **Integration Points**: All service interaction points
- **Core Logic**: All core business logic functions

### **Standard Paths (90%+)**

- **Utility Functions**: All utility and helper functions
- **Validation Logic**: All input validation and sanitization
- **Configuration**: All configuration loading and parsing
- **File Operations**: All file system operations

### **Edge Cases (80%+)**

- **Boundary Conditions**: Edge case handling
- **Optional Features**: Optional functionality
- **Debug Code**: Debug and logging code
- **Legacy Code**: Deprecated but maintained code

## Coverage Monitoring

### **Coverage Trends**

- **Historical Data**: Track coverage over time
- **Regression Detection**: Identify coverage drops
- **Improvement Tracking**: Monitor coverage improvements
- **Goal Setting**: Set and track coverage goals

### **Coverage Alerts**

- **Threshold Violations**: Alert when coverage drops below thresholds
- **New Code**: Alert for new code without tests
- **Coverage Gaps**: Identify specific uncovered code paths
- **Test Quality**: Monitor test effectiveness

## Coverage Tools

### **Coverage Commands**

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
dc tc

# Run tests with coverage and full dependency chain
dc tfc

# Generate coverage report only
dc tc --reporter=html

# Check coverage thresholds
dc tc --coverage.threshold.lines=90
```

### **Coverage Analysis**

```bash
# Analyze coverage trends
npm run coverage:analyze

# Generate coverage report
npm run coverage:report

# Check coverage thresholds
npm run coverage:check
```

## Coverage Best Practices

### **Test Coverage**

- **Write tests first**: Follow TDD practices
- **Cover all paths**: Test all code branches
- **Test edge cases**: Include boundary condition tests
- **Test error paths**: Test error handling and exceptions

### **Coverage Maintenance**

- **Regular reviews**: Review coverage reports regularly
- **Coverage goals**: Set and maintain coverage goals
- **Quality over quantity**: Focus on test quality, not just coverage
- **Continuous improvement**: Continuously improve test coverage

### **Coverage Reporting**

- **Clear reports**: Generate clear and actionable reports
- **Trend analysis**: Track coverage trends over time
- **Team awareness**: Share coverage information with team
- **Goal tracking**: Track progress toward coverage goals

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **Low Coverage**: Identify and add tests for uncovered code
2. **Coverage Gaps**: Focus on critical paths and error handling
3. **False Positives**: Exclude test files and configuration from coverage
4. **Performance Impact**: Optimize coverage collection for performance

### **Coverage Optimization**

- **Selective Coverage**: Focus coverage on critical code paths
- **Efficient Collection**: Optimize coverage collection performance
- **Meaningful Metrics**: Focus on meaningful coverage metrics
- **Quality Focus**: Prioritize test quality over coverage percentage

## Maintenance

### **Regular Updates**

- **Coverage Goals**: Update coverage goals based on project needs
- **Coverage Tools**: Update coverage tools and configurations
- **Coverage Reports**: Improve coverage reporting and analysis
- **Coverage Standards**: Maintain and improve coverage standards

### **Coverage Monitoring**

- **Automated Checks**: Implement automated coverage checks
- **Coverage Alerts**: Set up alerts for coverage violations
- **Coverage Reviews**: Regular coverage review and analysis
- **Coverage Improvements**: Continuous coverage improvement efforts
