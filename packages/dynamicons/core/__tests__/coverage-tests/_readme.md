# Coverage Tests

**Purpose**: Tests solely designed to increase the coverage report percentage. These tests focus on covering edge cases and uncovered code paths that are not typically covered by functional tests.

## Guidelines

- **Focus on Coverage**: These tests should specifically target lines, branches, or functions that are not covered by functional tests
- **Edge Cases**: Cover error conditions, boundary values, and exceptional scenarios
- **Minimal Logic**: Keep test logic simple and focused on coverage rather than complex scenarios
- **Naming Convention**: Use `.test-cov.ts` suffix to distinguish from functional tests

## Example Coverage Test

```typescript
// trial-coverage-test.test-cov.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'
import { DynamiconsManagerService } from '../../src/services/DynamiconsManager.service.js'

describe('Coverage Tests - Dynamicons Manager', () => {
    it('should handle undefined input for coverage', () => {
        const manager = new DynamiconsManagerService()
        // This test specifically covers the undefined input path
        expect(() => manager.processData(undefined)).toThrow()
    })
})
```

## Coverage Targets

- **Line Coverage**: Aim for 100% line coverage
- **Branch Coverage**: Cover all conditional branches
- **Function Coverage**: Ensure all functions are called
- **Statement Coverage**: Cover all executable statements
