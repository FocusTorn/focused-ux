4. Extension is automatically installed for testing

## Context Menu Groups

The extension organizes commands into logical groups in the context menu:

- **fux-terminal**: Terminal-related operations
- **fux-file**: File management operations
- **fux-format**: Code formatting operations
- **fux-package**: Package and extension operations

## Architecture

This extension follows the F-UX architecture pattern with separate core and extension packages:

- **Core Package** (`@fux/project-butler-core`): Contains the business logic and services
- **Extension Package** (`fux-project-butler`): VS Code extension wrapper

### Core Services

- **FileSystemService**: Manages file operations and backups
- **ProcessService**: Handles terminal and process management
- **VSCodeTerminalService**: Manages VS Code terminal interactions

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- VS Code 1.99.3+
- TypeScript 5.8+
- Poetry (for Poetry shell functionality)

### Building
```bash
# Build the extension
nx build project-butler-ext

# Package the extension
nx package project-butler-ext
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests
nx test project-butler-core
```

## Dependencies
