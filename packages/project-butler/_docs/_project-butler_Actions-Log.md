### 2025-01-27 - Interface Adapter Export Strategy Implementation

**Action**: Adopted comprehensive interface adapter exporting strategy from GWC (Ghost Writer Core)

**Changes Made**:

- Updated `packages/project-butler/core/src/index.ts` to implement comprehensive export categorization
- Added clear separation between Service Interfaces and Adapter Interfaces
- Maintained existing Services and Constants exports
- Verified build success with `pae pbc b`

**Export Strategy Structure**:

```typescript
// Service Interfaces
export * from './_interfaces/IPackageJsonFormattingService.js'
export * from './_interfaces/ITerminalManagementService.js'
export * from './_interfaces/IBackupManagementService.js'
export * from './_interfaces/IPoetryShellService.js'
export * from './_interfaces/IProjectButlerManagerService.js'

// Adapter Interfaces
export * from './_interfaces/IFileSystemAdapter.js'
export * from './_interfaces/IPathAdapter.js'
export * from './_interfaces/IYamlAdapter.js'

// Services
export * from './services/PackageJsonFormatting.service.js'
export * from './services/TerminalManagement.service.js'
export * from './services/BackupManagement.service.js'
export * from './services/PoetryShell.service.js'
export * from './services/ProjectButlerManager.service.js'

// Constants
export * from './_config/constants.js'
```

**Benefits**:

- Clear categorization of exports for better developer experience
- Consistent with GWC's comprehensive export coverage pattern
- Improved maintainability and discoverability of interfaces
- Better separation of concerns between business logic and VSCode integration

**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Build Status**: ✅ Successful (`pae pbc b`)
