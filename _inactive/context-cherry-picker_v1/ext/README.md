A standalone VS Code extension for advanced context selection and formatting, designed to streamline the process of gathering and organizing project context for AI interactions and documentation.

## Overview

Context Cherry Picker (CCP) is part of the Focused UX (F-UX) suite of extensions designed to enhance context management and AI interaction workflows. It provides sophisticated tools for selecting, organizing, and formatting project context with intelligent filtering and token management capabilities.

## Features

### üìä Context Management
- **Saved States**: Save multiple context configurations
- **State Management**: Load, delete, and manage saved states
- **Context Export**: Copy formatted context to clipboard
- **Project-specific Contexts**: Organize contexts by project

### üîç Smart Filtering

## Usage Examples

### Basic Context Selection
1. Open the Context Cherry Picker activity bar view
2. Navigate to the Context Explorer
3. Check/uncheck files and folders to include in context
4. Use the token counter to monitor context size

### Saving Context States
1. Select desired files and folders
2. Click "Save Checked State" in the explorer title bar
3. Enter a name for the state
4. The state is saved for future use

### Loading Saved States
1. Open the Saved States view
2. Click on a saved state to load it
3. The Context Explorer updates with the saved selection

### Copying Formatted Context
1. Select files and folders in the Context Explorer
2. Click "Copy Context of Checked Items" in the title bar
3. Formatted context is copied to clipboard
4. Paste into AI chat or documentation

### Configuring Filters
1. Open Quick Settings view
2. Configure "Always Show" patterns for important files
3. Set "Always Hide" patterns for excluded files
4. Define "Show If Selected" patterns for conditional files

## Configuration

### Quick Settings Options
- **Always Show Patterns**: Files that should always be included
- **Always Hide Patterns**: Files that should always be excluded
- **Show If Selected Patterns**: Files that appear only when selected
- **Token Limit**: Maximum tokens for context (default: 4000)
- **Include File Contents**: Whether to include file contents in context

## Architecture

This extension follows the F-UX architecture pattern with separate core and extension packages:

- **Core Package** (`@fux/context-cherry-picker-core`): Contains the business logic and services
- **Extension Package** (`fux-context-cherry-picker`): VS Code extension wrapper

### Core Services

- **CCP_ManagerService**: Main orchestration service
- **ContextDataCollectorService**: Collects and processes file data
- **ContextFormattingService**: Formats context for output
- **TokenizerService**: Handles token counting and estimation
- **FileExplorerService**: Manages the file explorer interface
- **CCP_StorageService**: Manages saved states and persistence

### External Dependencies
- **gpt-tokenizer**: Accurate token counting for GPT models
- **js-yaml**: YAML configuration parsing
- **micromatch**: Advanced glob pattern matching
