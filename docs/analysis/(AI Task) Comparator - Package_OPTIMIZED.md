# AI Comparator Package Framework

## **AI PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS**

**CONSUMPTION**: Read systematically, identify violations, establish reference patterns
**RETENTION**: Store as architectural alignment knowledge with remediation actions
**APPLICATION**: Use for package comparison, violation detection, and alignment decisions

## **STRATEGIC MISSION**

**Purpose**: Systematic architectural alignment engine for establishing single source of truth
**Goal**: Drive concrete remediation actions, not documentation
**Focus**: Violation detection → Reference establishment → Concrete actions

## **CORE OBJECTIVES**

1. **Violation Detection**: Identify architectural rule violations requiring remediation
2. **Reference Establishment**: Create clear reference packages for alignment
3. **Concrete Actions**: Generate specific remediation steps with success criteria
4. **Standards Enforcement**: Treat architectural compliance as non-negotiable
5. **Decision Interface**: Use flattened multiselect (`✅⚠️❌`) for alignment decisions

## **SYSTEMATIC COMPARISON FRAMEWORK**

### **PHASE 1: DEEP COMPREHENSION PREREQUISITE**

**AI TASK**: Execute Deep Comprehension analysis for both packages

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENT**: Complete Deep Comprehension before comparison
**DATA TO EXTRACT**: Package identity, architecture patterns, functionality, implementation, integration
**RETENTION PATTERN**: Store as structured comprehension models for both packages

### **PHASE 2: VIOLATION DETECTION**

**AI TASK**: Identify architectural rule violations requiring immediate remediation

**CRITICAL VIOLATIONS TO DETECT**:

- Dependency classification violations (runtime deps in devDependencies)
- Architectural rule violations (VSCode value imports in core)
- Build configuration inconsistencies (non-standard executors)
- Testing standard violations (missing integration tests)
- Package structure violations (non-compliant organization)

**RETENTION PATTERN**: Store as violation catalog with remediation requirements

### **PHASE 3: REFERENCE PATTERN ESTABLISHMENT**

**AI TASK**: Identify compliant packages as alignment targets

**REFERENCE CRITERIA**:

- Follows all architectural rules
- Demonstrates best practices
- Has comprehensive testing
- Proper dependency management
- Clean configuration patterns

**RETENTION PATTERN**: Store as reference catalog with alignment targets

### **PHASE 4: CONCRETE ACTION GENERATION**

**AI TASK**: Create specific remediation steps with success criteria

**ACTION REQUIREMENTS**:

- Specific file changes required
- Clear implementation steps
- Success criteria definition
- Validation methods
- Priority classification

**RETENTION PATTERN**: Store as action catalog with implementation details

### **PHASE 5: ALIGNMENT DECISION INTERFACE**

**AI TASK**: Present findings with flattened multiselect for easy decision-making

**DECISION FORMAT**: `✅⚠️❌` for each finding
**PURPOSE**: Quick visual decision-making interface
**USAGE**: Select appropriate icon(s) based on acceptability assessment

**REQUIRED FOR EACH**: Description, Deviations, Result, Acceptability, Response

## **ACCEPTABILITY CLASSIFICATION**

### **ACCEPTABILITY INDICATORS**

- **✅ ACCEPTABLE**: No changes needed - both approaches valid and appropriate
- **⚠️ SHOULD IMPROVE**: Target package should adopt better patterns from reference
- **✅ SHOULD ADOPT**: Reference package has superior patterns for adoption

### **RESPONSE SELECTION PATTERN**

**Format**: Always use flattened multiselect `✅⚠️❌`
**Purpose**: Quick visual decision-making interface for architectural alignment
**Usage**: Select appropriate icon(s) based on acceptability assessment

## **ALIGNMENT STRATEGY FRAMEWORK**

### **CRITICAL VIOLATIONS (MUST FIX)**

- Dependency classification violations
- Architectural rule violations
- Build configuration inconsistencies
- Testing standard violations

### **ALIGNMENT PROCESS**

1. **Identify Violations**: Flag as ⚠️ SHOULD IMPROVE
2. **Establish Reference**: Use compliant package as target
3. **Create Actions**: Specify concrete remediation steps
4. **Define Success**: Clear alignment completion criteria

### **PRESERVATION CRITERIA**

- Runtime dependencies explicitly allowed by architecture
- Configuration strategies serving different needs
- Service architecture patterns suiting different use cases
- Testing complexity providing value

## **AI OUTPUT FORMAT**

### **COMPARATOR RESPONSE TEMPLATE**

```markdown

```

## **AI KNOWLEDGE RETENTION STRATEGY**

### **STRUCTURED MEMORY PATTERNS**

1. **Violation Catalog**: Violation → Impact → Remediation
2. **Reference Catalog**: Pattern → Implementation → Quality
