# AI Deep Comprehension Workspace Framework - ULTRA OPTIMIZED

## PROCESSING DIRECTIVE

Read systematically → Build workspace mental models → Retain architectural patterns → Apply for analysis/coordination/decisions

## CORE OBJECTIVES

1. Workspace Identity → Purpose, mission, scope, boundaries
2. Architectural Patterns → Design decisions, patterns, anti-patterns across packages
3. Package Relationships → Dependencies, communication, coordination
4. Build System → Configuration, execution order, optimization
5. Scalability Patterns → Growth strategies, evolution patterns

## EXECUTION PHASES

### PHASE 1: WORKSPACE IDENTITY

**DATA**: Workspace name/mission, overall purpose/value proposition, target problem domain/scope, user workflows across packages, competitive advantages
**RETENTION**: Structured workspace identity model

### PHASE 2: ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS

**DATA**: Package classification patterns (core/ext/shared/tool), design patterns used consistently, service architecture approaches, interface organization strategies, dependency management patterns
**RETENTION**: Workspace pattern catalog with cross-package examples

### PHASE 3: PACKAGE RELATIONSHIPS

**DATA**: Dependency networks/build order, cross-package communication patterns, shared resource usage, coordinated functionality, integration points
**RETENTION**: Relationship map with interaction patterns

### PHASE 4: BUILD SYSTEM ANALYSIS

**DATA**: Build system configuration patterns, execution order/dependencies, caching strategies/optimization, tool integration/performance, scalability characteristics
**RETENTION**: Build system model with optimization patterns

### PHASE 5: SCALABILITY UNDERSTANDING

**DATA**: Package addition patterns, architecture evolution strategies, performance scaling approaches, maintenance/update patterns, future growth planning
**RETENTION**: Scalability model with evolution patterns

## MEMORY PATTERNS

1. **Workspace Identity**: Mission → Purpose → Scope → Boundaries
2. **Pattern Catalog**: Architecture → Implementation → Quality → Consistency
3. **Relationship Map**: Dependencies → Communication → Coordination → Integration
4. **Build System**: Configuration → Execution → Optimization → Performance
5. **Scalability Model**: Growth → Evolution → Performance → Maintenance

## CROSS-REFERENCE LINKING

- Link workspace patterns to package implementations
- Connect dependencies to build order
- Map communication patterns to functionality
- Associate scalability patterns to performance
