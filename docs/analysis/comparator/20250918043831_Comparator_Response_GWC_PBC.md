1. **Enhanced Testing Patterns**: Project Butler Core should consider adopting Ghost Writer's enhanced testing patterns, particularly dedicated edge case testing (ImportGeneratorService.edge-cases.test.ts) and complex scenario testing patterns
2. **Vitest Configuration Optimization**: Ghost Writer Core should consider adopting Project Butler's enhanced vitest configuration with thread pool optimization, timeout settings, and performance tuning

### For Preservation

1. **Runtime Dependency Patterns**: Both packages correctly handle their runtime dependencies (TypeScript for Ghost Writer, js-yaml for Project Butler) - these patterns should be preserved
2. **Service Architecture Patterns**: Both utility pattern (Ghost Writer) and orchestration pattern (Project Butler) are appropriate for their use cases and should be preserved
3. **Configuration Management Strategies**: Both user configuration (Ghost Writer) and file-based configuration (Project Butler) approaches are appropriate and should be preserved

### Overall Assessment

The comparison reveals that both Ghost Writer Core and Project Butler Core are architecturally sound packages with excellent compliance to established patterns. The key differences are primarily in testing sophistication and configuration optimization rather than architectural violations. Ghost Writer demonstrates more advanced testing patterns that could benefit Project Butler, while Project Butler shows more optimized vitest configuration that could benefit Ghost Writer. Both packages serve their specific use cases effectively with appropriate architectural patterns.
