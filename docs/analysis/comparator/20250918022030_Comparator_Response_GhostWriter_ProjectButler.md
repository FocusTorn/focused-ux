## Recommendations

### For Immediate Remediation

1. **Dependency Classification Fix**: Ghost Writer must move TypeScript from devDependencies to dependencies section to comply with architectural standards
2. **Enhanced Testing Patterns**: Project Butler should consider adopting Ghost Writer's enhanced testing patterns with complex scenarios and edge case testing for improved reliability
3. **Constants Export Strategy**: Project Butler could benefit from exporting constants for configuration values, similar to Ghost Writer's approach

### For Preservation

1. **Runtime Dependency Usage**: Both packages should maintain their current runtime dependency usage as it's explicitly allowed by architecture (TypeScript for AST parsing, js-yaml for YAML parsing)
2. **Configuration Management**: Both packages should maintain their current configuration approaches as they serve different use cases effectively
3. **Service Architecture**: Both packages should maintain their current service architecture patterns as they are appropriate for their respective complexity levels

### Architectural Standards Alignment

**Reference Pattern**: Project Butler demonstrates proper dependency classification following architectural rules
**Target Package**: Ghost Writer needs alignment with dependency management standards
**Action Required**: Move TypeScript from devDependencies to dependencies in Ghost Writer core package.json
**Success Criteria**: Both packages follow proper dependency classification rules

### Overall Assessment

Project Butler demonstrates excellent architectural compliance with FocusedUX patterns, particularly in dependency management. Ghost Writer has one critical architectural violation in dependency classification that needs immediate remediation. Once fixed, both packages will maintain high architectural standards while serving their intended purposes effectively.

The key insight is that architectural standards must be consistently applied across all packages, with proper dependency classification being a critical compliance requirement. The differences identified include both acceptable functional variations and one architectural violation that requires alignment.
