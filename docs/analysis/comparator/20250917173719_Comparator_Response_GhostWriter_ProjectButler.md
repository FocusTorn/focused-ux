## Critical Architectural Differences

### 1. Runtime Dependency Patterns

- **Ghost Writer**: TypeScript as runtime dependency for AST parsing

    - Project Butler maintains zero runtime dependencies, implementing all functionality through pure business logic without external parsing libraries.

- **Result**:
    - Ghost Writer has higher build complexity and maintenance overhead due to TypeScript compilation requirements
    - Project Butler achieves dependency-free operation with simpler build processes and smaller bundle sizes
