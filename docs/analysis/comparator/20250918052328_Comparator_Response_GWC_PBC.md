4. **Explicit Declaration Root Directory**: GWC should consider adding explicit declaration root directory specification in build configuration for better build control.

5. **Interface Export Organization**: PBC should consider adopting GWC's separation of adapter interfaces from service interfaces in exports for better organization.

### For Preservation

1. **Service Architecture Patterns**: Both packages should preserve their current service architecture patterns as they are appropriate for their respective functional complexity levels.

2. **External Dependency Strategies**: Both packages should preserve their current external dependency strategies as they reflect appropriate functional requirements.

3. **Adapter Interface Patterns**: GWC should preserve its extensive adapter interface pattern as it provides better separation of concerns and testability.

4. **Manager Pattern**: PBC should preserve its manager pattern as it provides better organization for complex multi-service operations.

### Overall Assessment

The comparison reveals that both packages follow solid architectural patterns appropriate for their functional requirements. GWC excels in adapter pattern implementation and interface organization, while PBC demonstrates superior testing configuration and comprehensive configuration management. The main areas for improvement are in testing sophistication (GWC should adopt PBC's advanced testing configuration) and configuration management (GWC should consider PBC's comprehensive approach). Both packages maintain good compliance with project guidelines, with only minor cleanup needed in GWC's commented legacy code.
