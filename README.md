# FocusedUX Monorepo

A comprehensive monorepo for VSCode extensions and development tools, built with Nx and TypeScript.

## Package Classification

The FocusedUX monorepo follows a **standardized package classification system** that determines architectural patterns, build configurations, and testing strategies.

**ðŸ“‹ Reference**: See [Package Archetypes](./docs/Package-Archetypes.md) for the complete single source of truth on package classification, including detailed descriptions, examples, and implementation guidelines.

### **Quick Reference**

- **Direct TSX Executed** (`libs/tools/`) - Standalone utilities
- **Consumable Package: Shared Utility** (`libs/`) - Shared utilities
- **Consumable Package: Feature Utility** (`packages/{feature}/`) - Feature-specific utilities
- **Consumable Package: Core Extension Feature Logic** (`packages/{feature-name}/core`) - Business logic
- **Pre-Packaged Extension: Single Feature** (`packages/{feature-name}/ext`) - VSCode extensions
- **Nx Alignment Generators** (`plugins/`) - ðŸš§ In Development
- **Monolithic Orchestrator** - ðŸ“‹ Planned

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
