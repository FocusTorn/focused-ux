## **COMMAND PURPOSE**

**Primary Objective**: Orchestrate comprehensive package analysis using modular phase approach
**Scope**: Execute phases sequentially, combine outputs, validate completeness
**Output**: Comprehensive package understanding with structured knowledge retention

## **EXECUTION PROTOCOL**

### **STEP 1: PRE-EXECUTION SETUP**

**AI TASK**: Prepare for comprehensive package analysis

**CLEANUP PROCESS**:

- [ ] Delete existing staging file: **STAGING_FILE**
- [ ] Delete existing output file: **FINAL_OUTPUT**
- [ ] Ensure clean workspace for new analysis

**REQUIREMENTS**:

- [ ] Target package identified and accessible
- [ ] Workspace architecture understanding established
- [ ] Documentation access confirmed
- [ ] Source code access verified
- [ ] Context window allocated for deep analysis

**VALIDATION**:

- [ ] Package exists and is accessible
- [ ] All required files can be read
- [ ] Workspace patterns understood
- [ ] Analysis scope confirmed

### **STEP 2: PHASE EXECUTION SEQUENCE**

**AI TASK**: Execute analysis phases in sequence

**PHASE EXECUTION ORDER**:

1. **Phase 1: Package Identity Analysis** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
    - Execute: **PHASE_1_CMD**
    - Result: Writes to **STAGING_FILE**

2. **Phase 2: Architecture Pattern Analysis** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
    - Execute: **PHASE_2_CMD**
    - Result: Appends to staging file

3. **Phase 3: Functionality Mapping** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
    - Execute: **PHASE_3_CMD**
    - Result: Appends to staging file
    - Status: Complete implementation available

4. **Phase 4: Implementation Analysis** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
    - Execute: **PHASE_4_CMD**
    - Result: Appends to staging file
    - Status: Complete implementation available

5. **Phase 5: Integration Understanding** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
    - Execute: **PHASE_5_CMD**
    - Result: Appends to staging file
    - Status: Complete implementation available

6. **Phase 6: Final Synthesis** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
    - Execute: **PHASE_6_CMD**
    - Result: Creates **FINAL_OUTPUT**
    - Status: Ready to synthesize available phase data

### **STEP 3: EXECUTION VALIDATION**

**AI TASK**: Validate that all phases executed successfully

**VALIDATION PROCESS**:

- [ ] Check that staging file exists: **STAGING_FILE**
- [ ] Verify Phase 1 is marked as complete (✅)
- [ ] Verify Phase 3 is marked as complete (✅)
- [ ] Verify Phase 4 is marked as complete (✅)
- [ ] Verify Phase 5 is marked as complete (✅)

## **OUTPUT FORMAT**

### **ANALYSIS DOCUMENT LOCATION**

**File**: **STAGING_FILE**

**Document Structure**:
