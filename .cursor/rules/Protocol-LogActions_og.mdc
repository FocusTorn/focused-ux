# Protocol: LogActions.mdc

## **Purpose**

This protocol defines the comprehensive structure and content requirements for action logs, ensuring consistent, detailed, and valuable documentation of all significant development activities, failures, recoveries, and lessons learned.

## **Protocol Requirements**

### **Data Acquisition and Information Gathering**

#### **Conversation Scope Requirements**

- **Complete Conversation Coverage**: Action logs MUST reflect the ENTIRE conversation from initial prompt to completion, not just since summary creation
- **Multi-Package Conversations**: If conversation spans multiple packages, each package's feature docs MUST be updated in the same comprehensive manner
- **Chronological Accuracy**: Document events in the order they occurred, including all failed attempts and corrections
- **Task Tracker Synchronization**: Both Actions Log entries and Task Tracker updates MUST reference the complete conversation from the very first prompt, not just recent completions

#### **Data Verification Protocol**

- **File Timestamp Verification**: Use PowerShell `Get-FileStats.ps1` to get actual file modification times
- **Specific Files**: `.\scripts\Get-FileStats.ps1 -FilePaths @("file1.ts", "file2.js")`
- **Project Directory**: `.\scripts\Get-FileStats.ps1 -Directories @("packages/project-name")`
- **Format**: Use `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]` format from verification output
- **NEVER**: Use estimated dates, current system time, or placeholders

#### **Information Gathering Standards**

- **Explicit User Requests**: Only document when user explicitly requests documentation
- **Completion Confirmation**: User must confirm work is actually complete before documentation
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly define what should be documented based on user direction
- **Success Focus**: Document successful outcomes and conversation elements that directly enabled success
- **Documentation-Only Changes Excluded**: Documentation-only changes (updating docs, comments, README files) should NOT be tracked in completed tasks or actions log
- **Code/Implementation Focus**: Only track changes that involve actual code implementation, bug fixes, feature additions, or architectural changes

#### **Multi-Package Documentation Protocol**

- **Package-Specific Logs**: Each package affected MUST have its own action log entry in `packages/{package-name}/_docs/{package-name}-actions-log.md`
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Each package log must include the same level of detail as the main Actions Log
- **Cross-Package Dependencies**: Document how changes in one package affected others
- **Consistent Structure**: All package-specific logs must follow the same 12-section structure
- **Main Log Reference**: Package-specific logs should reference the main Actions Log entry for context

#### **Task Tracker Integration Protocol**

- **Automatic Updates**: Action log entries MUST automatically update the corresponding task tracker file
- **Completed Tasks**: Move completed tasks from "Pending Tasks" to "Completed Tasks" section with timestamp
- **New Tasks**: Add any new tasks identified during the conversation to "Pending Tasks" section
- **Future Enhancements**: Add new proposed enhancements to "Future Enhancement Suggestions" section
- **Conversation Reference**: All task tracker updates MUST reference the complete conversation from first prompt
- **Consolidation**: Maintain consolidated "Future Enhancement Suggestions" section that aggregates all suggestions
- **Deduplication**: When new enhancements are proposed, add them to consolidated list if unique, or add sub-bullets to existing items

#### **Default Action Log Structure Protocol**

- **Completed Tasks Placement**: Completed tasks MUST be placed underneath the "Future Enhancement Suggestions" section
- **Combined Format**: Use simple flat list format with `- [x]` checkboxes for completed tasks
- **No Duplicates**: Ensure only one "Completed Tasks" section exists per action log
- **Chronological Order**: List completed tasks in chronological order of completion
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include ALL completed tasks from the entire conversation, not just recent ones

#### **Conversation Analysis Protocol**

- **Systematic Review**: Review every turn of the conversation from initial user request to completion
- **Self-Critical Focus**: Focus on failures, corrections, and actionable lessons
- **Success Analysis**: Document what core principles or patterns led to efficient and correct outcomes
- **Failure Analysis**: Document where approach failed, root causes, and how user feedback corrected behavior
- **Actionable Lessons**: Extract the most critical, transferable lessons from the interaction

### **Mandatory Task Tracker Updates**

Every action log entry MUST also update the corresponding task tracker file with the following process:

#### **Task Tracker Update Process**

1. **Read Current Task Tracker**: Load the current task tracker file (`packages/{package-name}/_docs/{package-name}-task-tracker.md`)
2. **Identify Completed Tasks**: Review the conversation to identify all tasks that were completed (exclude documentation-only changes)
3. **Move Completed Tasks**: Move completed tasks from "Pending Tasks" to "Completed Tasks" section with current timestamp
4. **Add New Tasks**: Add any new tasks identified during the conversation to "Pending Tasks" section (exclude documentation-only tasks)
5. **Update Future Enhancements**: Add new proposed enhancements to "Future Enhancement Suggestions" section
6. **Maintain Consolidation**: Ensure the consolidated "Future Enhancement Suggestions" section aggregates all suggestions
7. **Reference Complete Conversation**: All updates must reference the entire conversation from first prompt
8. **Exclude Documentation Changes**: Do not track documentation-only changes (updating docs, comments, README files) in task tracker

#### **Task Tracker Format Requirements**

- **Completed Tasks**: Use format `- [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]` with `- [x]` checkboxes for individual tasks
- **Pending Tasks**: Use format `- [ ]` checkboxes for incomplete tasks
- **Future Enhancements**: Use bold categories with sub-bullets for specific suggestions
- **Chronological Order**: List completed tasks in chronological order of completion
- **No Duplicates**: Ensure no duplicate tasks exist across sections

#### **What Should Be Tracked**

**Include in Completed Tasks and Actions Log:**

- Code implementation changes (new features, bug fixes, refactoring)
- Architectural changes (package structure, build system modifications)
- Configuration changes (project.json, package.json, build configs)
- Test implementation (unit tests, integration tests, test frameworks)

### **Examples**

#### **Good Summary**

"Successfully transformed standalone scripts collection into unified Nx core package architecture, achieving 100% type safety, 79% code quality improvement, and complete architectural compliance with established patterns."

#### **Good Root Cause Analysis**

- **Original Architecture**: 12 standalone scripts with manual orchestration and scattered error handling
- **Architectural Misalignment**: Scripts violated core package principles and lacked proper TypeScript structure
- **Build System Issues**: Manual execution without Nx caching, dependency management, or proper build targets

#### **Good Critical Failure Entry**

1. **Architecture Pattern Misunderstanding**:
    - **Failure**: Misinterpreted `dynamicons-assets` as "tool" package, leading to incorrect `project.json` configuration
    - **Root Cause**: Assumed package type without verification against architectural documentation
    - **Recovery**: User correction - asset processing is business logic requiring core package pattern for orchestrator readiness
    - **Prevention**: Always verify architectural patterns with user before implementing

#### **Good Key Anti-patterns**

- **Business Logic in Extensions**: Anti-pattern of placing asset processing logic in extension packages instead of core packages
- **Explicit `any` Types**: Anti-pattern of using `any` types instead of proper interfaces and type guards
- **Scattered Error Handling**: Anti-pattern of individual error handling in each script instead of centralized error management

#### **Good Lessons Learned Structure**

**Correct Methodology**:

- **Architectural Pattern Verification**: Always confirm package type (core vs tool vs ext) before implementing build configurations
- **Working Directory Dependencies**: Nx build commands are sensitive to working directory - always run from workspace root
- **Systematic Change Management**: When making related changes, ensure consistency across all affected components

**Pitfalls and Problems**:

- **User Feedback Integration**: When user questions logical consistency ("If there are references to error, why were they changed to \_error"), this indicates immediate correction needed
- **Incremental Fixing Without Consistency**: Fixed errors individually without maintaining logical consistency across related changes
- **Type Safety Validation**: Don't just make TypeScript happy - ensure types match actual runtime behavior

#### **Good Protocol Violations**

- **Initial Response Protocol**: Failed to read `.cursorrules` at conversation start - corrected by implementing mandatory pre-response validation
- **Architectural Misinterpretation**: Assumed package type without verification - corrected by asking user for clarification
- **Error Handling Inconsistency**: Made changes without considering all references - corrected by systematic review and fix

#### **Good Multi-Package Documentation**

**Main Actions Log Entry**: `docs/Actions-Log.md`

- Comprehensive entry covering entire conversation and all packages affected

**Package-Specific Logs**:

- `packages/dynamicons/_docs/assets-actions-log.md` - Detailed Dynamicons Assets transformation
- `packages/dynamicons/_docs/core-actions-log.md` - Core package changes
- `packages/dynamicons/_docs/ext-actions-log.md` - Extension package changes

**Cross-Package Dependencies Documented**:

- How asset processing changes affected core package structure
- How build configuration changes impacted extension package dependencies

#### **Good Task Tracker Integration**

**Actions Log Entry**: `packages/dynamicons/_docs/assets-actions-log.md`

- Comprehensive entry covering entire conversation from first prompt
- Completed tasks moved to "Completed Tasks" section with timestamps
- New tasks added to "Pending Tasks" section
- Future enhancements added to "Future Enhancement Suggestions"

**Task Tracker Updates**: `packages/dynamicons/_docs/assets-task-tracker.md`
