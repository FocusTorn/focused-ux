**üö® CRITICAL SAFETY PROTOCOL - NEVER DEVIATE FROM THIS üö®**

## **QUESTION vs DIRECTIVE DISTINCTION - ABSOLUTE MANDATORY RULE**

**VIOLATION OF THIS RULE CAN CAUSE SEVERE DAMAGE TO ANY PROJECT**

### **QUESTIONS (Seeking Understanding) - ANSWER ONLY, NO EXECUTION**

- Start with: "Why...", "How...", "What...", "When...", "Where...", "Is...", "Are...", "Can...", "Should...", "Would...", "Could..."
- Contain uncertainty: "I wonder...", "I'm curious...", "I'm not sure...", "Maybe...", "Perhaps..."
- End with question marks (?)
- **RESPONSE**: Answer the question, explain, provide information. DO NOT execute ANY commands.

### **DIRECTIVES (Requiring Action) - EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY**

- Start with action words: "Do...", "Run...", "Execute...", "Create...", "Delete...", "Fix...", "Update...", "Commit...", "Push..."
- Contain imperatives: "We need to...", "You should...", "Let's...", "I want to..."
- **RESPONSE**: Execute the requested action immediately.

### **SAFETY CHECKS - MANDATORY**

1. **Question Mark Rule**: NEVER execute commands for statements ending with "?" unless explicitly confirmed as directive
2. **Confirmation for Ambiguous Cases**: If intent unclear, ask: "Are you asking me to explain or take action?"
3. **Pre-Execution Safety**: Before ANY command execution, confirm: "You've given me a directive to [action]. Should I proceed?"

### **CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATION**

- Questions misinterpreted as directives can lead to:
    - Unwanted file deletions
    - Incorrect commits
    - Broken workflows
    - Data loss
    - Project corruption
    - System damage

**THIS RULE IS NON-NEGOTIABLE AND MUST BE FOLLOWED WITHOUT EXCEPTION IN ALL WORKSPACES**

- Don't defend misdiagnoses when user provides corrections
- Don't ignore explicit user feedback about performance or behavior
- Don't continue with failed approaches without pivoting

- Don't leave incomplete implementations
- Don't ignore linter errors or type issues

### **‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Testing Anti-Patterns**

- Don't bypass real runtime behavior with complex mocks
- Don't ignore user feedback about testing flaws - investigate architectural implications
- Don't create elaborate mock hierarchies that compete with production patterns
- Don't treat test failures as isolated issues without considering systemic problems
- Don't test only mock replacements without validating actual runtime behavior
- **FORBIDDEN**: Assume modern architecture patterns without verification - always confirm technology choices with users
- **FORBIDDEN**: Implement solutions before understanding the actual problem scope
- **FORBIDDEN**: Ignore performance implications of large test files (750+ lines) - split proactively
- **FORBIDDEN**: Over-engineer solutions when simpler approaches exist
- **FORBIDDEN**: Skip environment variable verification when UI operations hang in tests
- **FORBIDDEN**: Use command-line parameters for module loading when configuration file options exist
- **FORBIDDEN**: Ignore user feedback about environment-specific behavior differences

### **‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Poor Template Management**

- Don't hardcode configuration templates in validation logic
- Don't place templates outside the tool package that uses them
- Don't use inappropriate path resolution patterns for the module system in use
- Don't skip incremental validation of file loading implementations

### **‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Documentation Violations**

- **Skipping Date Verification**: NEVER write log entries without verifying actual file modification timestamps
- **Making Up Dates**: NEVER use estimated or guessed dates - always use verified file timestamps
- **Skipping Verification Commands**: NEVER skip file timestamp verification steps
- **Ignoring Date Guidelines**: NEVER ignore explicit date handling requirements in documentation protocols
- **Failing to Correct**: If you violate date verification, you MUST correct the entry immediately

### **‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Environment Configuration Violations**

- **Environment Variable Neglect**: NEVER skip environment variable verification when behavior differs between environments
- **Configuration Over Command-Line**: NEVER use command-line parameters when configuration file options provide better reliability
- **User Feedback Dismissal**: NEVER ignore user observations about environment-specific behavior differences

---

## **Quality Assurance Protocols**

### **Build Verification**

- **Always run builds first** - ensure clean state before testing
- **Fix build errors immediately** - don't proceed with broken builds
- **Use appropriate cache bypass when troubleshooting** - follow project-specific guidance

### **Test Execution**

- **Run full test suites** - ensure no regressions
- **Verify test isolation** - tests shouldn't interfere with each other
- **Validate mocks** - ensure they properly simulate real behavior
- **Measure performance** - before/after metrics for optimizations
- **Test real runtime behavior** - validate actual production patterns, not just mock replacements
- **Create integration tests first** - validate core architectural patterns before fixing individual test failures
- **Investigate user testing insights** - treat feedback about testing flaws as potential architectural revelations
- **Mock complex internal methods** - prevent test timeouts by isolating unit tests from complex dependencies
- **Split large test files** - proactively break down test files exceeding 500 lines to prevent performance issues

### **Documentation Updates**

- **Update project logs** - document successful implementations and lessons learned
- **Include failure documentation** - what was tried and failed (MANDATORY)
- **Update relevant strategies** - testing strategies, architectural patterns
- **Document anti-patterns** - prevent future mistakes
- **MANDATORY DATE VERIFICATION**: Before writing any log entry, you MUST:
    1. Identify the relevant project directory
    2. Run appropriate file timestamp verification command for the system
    3. Use the exact timestamp returned
    4. If you fail to do this, you must correct the entry immediately
