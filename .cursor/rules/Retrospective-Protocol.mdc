# Retrospective Protocol

## **Purpose**

This protocol enables systematic learning and continuous improvement by analyzing session outcomes and integrating lessons into operational doctrine.

## **Quick Reference**

### **Execution Flow**

```
retro command issued
├─ Phase 1: Session Analysis (chat only)
├─ Phase 2: Lesson Distillation
├─ Phase 3: Doctrine Integration
├─ Phase 4: Documentation Updates
└─ Phase 5: Final Report
```

### **Key Outputs**

- **Session Analysis**: ≤10 key behavioral insights (chat only)
- **Doctrine Updates**: Universal and/or FocusedUX doctrine improvements
- **Actions Log Entry**: Document successful implementations and lessons
- **Testing Strategy Updates**: If test-related lessons learned

---

## **Phase 1: Session Analysis (Chat-Only Reflection)**

### **Directive**

Review every turn of the conversation from the initial user request to this point. Synthesize findings into a concise, self-critical analysis.

### **Output (Keep in chat only)**

Produce a bulleted list (≤10 points) of key behavioral insights focusing on:

#### **Successes**

- What core principles or patterns led to efficient and correct outcomes?
- Which established workflows proved effective?

#### **Failures & Corrections**

- Where did your approach fail? What was the root cause?
- How did the user's feedback correct your behavior?
- What misdiagnoses occurred and why?

#### **Actionable Lessons**

- What are the most critical, transferable lessons from this interaction?
- What patterns should be repeated or avoided in the future?

---

## **Phase 2: Lesson Distillation**

### **Directive**

Filter and abstract only the most valuable insights into **durable, universal principles.**

### **Keep (Universal Principles)**

- ✅ **Universal Principles**: Lessons that apply across any language, framework, or project
- ✅ **Critical Anti-Patterns**: Specific, dangerous actions that must be forbidden
- ✅ **Effective Protocols**: High-level workflows that proved successful
- ✅ **New User Feedback Patterns**: Insights from user corrections that reveal core logic flaws

### **Discard (Project-Specific Details)**

- ❌ **Project-Specific Details**: File paths, port numbers, specific function names
- ❌ **One-Off Trivia**: Information that is not a reusable pattern
- ❌ **Session Narrative**: The story of what you did (focus only on learning)

---

## **Phase 3: Doctrine Integration**

### **Directive**

Route lessons to the correct rule file based on scope and update accordingly.

### **Rule File Selection**

1. **Universal Target** (`.cursor/rules/Universal-Operational-Doctrine.mdc`): Universal AI behavior, operational workflows, cross-project principles
2. **Project-Specific Target** (`.cursor/rules/FocusedUX-Operational-Doctrine.mdc`): Repo workflows, testing patterns, architectural rules, project conventions
3. **Non-Duplication**: If both could apply, prefer project-specific; update universal only if it adds non-duplicative value

### **Integration Protocol**

1. **Read** the target rule file to understand current structure
2. **Find logical sections** for each distilled lesson
3. **Refine, Don't Just Append**: Improve existing rules with new insights; add new rules following established formatting
4. **Write-Location Checklist**: Explicitly list files and sections updated in final report
5. **Read-Write-Reread**: Confirm changes before reporting completion

### **Instruction Quality Requirements**

- **Voice**: Imperative and authoritative ("Always...", "Never...", "FORBIDDEN:...")
- **Language**: 100% universal and tool-agnostic (natural language only)
- **Conciseness**: Clear, concise, and non-redundant

---

## **Phase 4: Documentation Updates**

### **Actions Log Documentation**

- **Location**: `./docs/Actions-Log.md`
- **Format**: Date and descriptive title, high-level summary, key implementations, lessons learned
- **Placement**: Add to TOP of document
- **Purpose**: Living reference for successful patterns and solutions

#### **Date/Time Protocol**

**MANDATORY**: Always use PowerShell to get the actual last modified time of files worked on during the session:

**For Entire Project Analysis**:

```powershell
# Get file statistics for entire project directory
.\scripts\Get-FileStats.ps1 -Directories @("path/to/project")
```

**For Specific Files Worked On**:

```powershell
# Get file statistics for specific modified files
.\scripts\Get-FileStats.ps1 -FilePaths @("path/to/file1.ts", "path/to/file2.js", "path/to/file3.json")
```

**Format**: Use the output format `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]` for all Actions Log entry titles.

**Example**: `### [2025-08-22 13:11:06] Dynamicons Test Performance Optimization`

**Note**: Use the Maximum field from the output as the timestamp for the Actions Log entry. Use actual file modification times, not the current system time.

#### **Changelog Update Protocol**

**AUTOMATIC TRIGGER**: After completing any Actions Log entry, if the changes affected one or more packages specifically:

1. **Identify Affected Packages**: Determine which packages were modified during the session
2. **Update Package Changelogs**: For each affected package, update its `CHANGELOG.md` file
3. **Changelog Format**: Follow the established format with sections for Added, Changed, Fixed, Technical Improvements
4. **Version Tracking**: Use the same date format as the Actions Log entry for consistency

**Changelog Locations**:

- `packages/{package-name}/core/CHANGELOG.md`
- `packages/{package-name}/ext/CHANGELOG.md`

**Example Changelog Entry**:

```markdown
## [2025-08-22] - Session Title

### Added

- New feature description

### Changed

- Modified behavior description

### Fixed

- Bug fix description

### Technical Improvements

- Architectural or technical changes
```

### **Testing Strategy Documentation**

- **Location**: `docs/FocusedUX-Testing-Strategy.md` for project-specific patterns
- **Package-Specific**: `packages/{package}/__tests__/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` for unique requirements
- **Triggers**: Test failures, mock issues, debugging challenges, new anti-patterns
- **Format**: Problem description, root cause, solution, best practices, library coverage

### **SOP Documentation**

- **Location**: `docs/SOP.md` for comprehensive build system and architectural reference
- **Triggers**: Architectural changes, build system modifications, new package patterns, troubleshooting discoveries
- **Format**: Detailed technical documentation with examples, configurations, and step-by-step procedures
- **Cross-Reference**: Ensure consistency with doctrine files and testing strategy

### **Documentation Consistency Verification**

- **Before Implementation**: Consult `docs/SOP.md` and `docs/FocusedUX-Testing-Strategy.md`
- **During Implementation**: Reference documents to prevent deviations
- **After Implementation**: Verify alignment with documented patterns
- **Critical Rule**: Obtain explicit user verification before deviating from global strategies

---

## **Phase 5: Final Report**

### **Directive**

Present a clear, structured report concluding the retrospective.

### **Report Structure**

1. **Status of Doctrine**:
    - `✅ Universal Operational Doctrine updated.` OR
    - `✅ FocusedUX Operational Doctrine updated.` OR
    - `ℹ️ No universal lessons were distilled; no updates required.`

2. **Session Analysis**: The full bulleted list from Phase 1

3. **Files Updated**: Explicit list of files and sections modified

4. **Key Learnings**: Most important insights for future sessions

---

## **Execution Trigger**

- **Command**: `retro` - Triggers full retrospective analysis
- **Scope**: Entire session review and learning integration
- **Output**: Structured learning report with doctrine updates
- **Integration**: Updates both Universal and FocusedUX doctrine files as appropriate
