## **Phase 0: Session Analysis (Chat-Only Reflection)**

- **Directive:** Review every turn of the conversation from the initial user request up to this point. Synthesize your findings into a concise, self-critical analysis.
- **Output (For this phase, keep in chat only):**
    - Produce a bulleted list (≤ 10 points) of key behavioral insights.
    - Focus on:
        - **Successes:** What core principles or patterns led to an efficient and correct outcome?
        - **Failures & Corrections:** Where did your approach fail? What was the root cause? How did the user's feedback correct your behavior?
        - **Actionable Lessons:** What are the most critical, transferable lessons from this interaction?

---

## **Phase 1: Lesson Distillation**

- **Directive:** From your analysis in Phase 0, you will now filter and abstract only the most valuable insights into **durable, universal principles.**
- **Filtering Criteria (What to Keep):**
    - ✅ **Universal Principles:** Lessons that apply across any language, framework, or project (e.g., "Always verify an environment variable exists before using it").
    - ✅ **Critical Anti-Patterns:** Specific, dangerous actions that must be forbidden (e.g., "Never use streaming commands like `tail -f` which hang the terminal").
    - ✅ **Effective Protocols:** High-level workflows that proved successful (e.g., The "KILL FIRST, THEN RUN" pattern for restarting services).
    - ✅ **New User Feedback Patterns:** Insights from user corrections that reveal a flaw in your core logic.
- **Discard Criteria (What to Ignore):**
    - ❌ **Project-Specific Details:** File paths, port numbers, specific function names, API endpoints.
    - ❌ **One-Off Trivia:** Information that is not a reusable pattern.
    - ❌ **Session Narrative:** The story of what you did. Focus only on the _learning_.

---

## **Phase 2: Doctrine Integration**

- **Directive:** Route lessons to the correct rule file based on scope and update accordingly.
- **Rule File Discovery Protocol:**
    1.  **Universal Target (Universal-Operational-Doctrine.mdc):** If the lesson pertains to universal AI behavior, operational workflows, or cross-project principles, update this file.
    2.  **Project-Specific Target (FocusedUX-Operational-Doctrine.mdc):** If the lesson pertains to this repo's workflows, testing patterns, architectural rules, or project conventions, update this file.
    3.  **Non-Duplication:** If both could apply, prefer project-specific; update universal only if it adds non-duplicative value.
- **Integration Protocol:**
    1.  **Read** the target rule file to understand its current structure.
    2.  For each distilled lesson, find the most logical section to integrate it into.
    3.  **Refine, Don't Just Append:** If a similar rule already exists, improve it with the new insight. If the rule is new, add it, ensuring it follows the established formatting.
    4.  **Write-Location Checklist:** In your final report, explicitly list the files and sections updated.
    5.  **Read-Write-Reread:** Reopen updated files and confirm changes before reporting completion.
- **Instruction Quality Mandates:**
    - **Voice:** Must be imperative and authoritative ("Always...", "Never...", "FORBIDDEN:...").
    - **Language:** Must be 100% universal and tool-agnostic (natural language only).
    - **Conciseness:** Rules must be clear, concise, and non-redundant.

---

## **Phase 3: Actions-Log Documentation**

- **Directive:** Create or update the Actions-Log.md file in the `./docs` directory to catalog successful implementations and outcomes.
- **Documentation Requirements:**
    - **File Location:** Must be created in `./docs/Actions-Log.md`
    - **Entry Format:** Each entry must include:
        - Date and descriptive title (e.g., "2024-12-19 - Mockly Library Enhancement")
        - High-level summary of goals and outcomes
        - Key implementations and critical fixes applied
        - Lessons learned and actionable insights
    - **Entry Placement:** New entries MUST be added to the TOP of the document
    - **Purpose:** Serve as a living reference for successful patterns and solutions
    - **Maintenance:** Update this log whenever significant successful implementations are completed

---

## **Phase 4: Testing Strategy Documentation**

- **Directive:** For any test-related fixes that result in correct implementation, the Testing Strategy document MUST be updated to reflect the lessons learned and solutions applied.

---

## **Phase 4.1: Documentation Consistency Verification**

- **Directive:** Ensure that SOP and Global Testing Strategy documents are ALWAYS actively referenced to prevent deviations from established patterns.
- **Verification Requirements:**
    - **Before Implementation:** Always consult `docs/SOP.md` and `docs/global-testing-strategy.md` for established patterns
    - **During Implementation:** Reference these documents to ensure no deviations occur
    - **After Implementation:** Verify that the implementation aligns with documented patterns
    - **Documentation Updates:** If patterns change, update both documents to maintain consistency
- **Critical Rules:**
    - **SOP Compliance:** All architectural decisions must align with `docs/SOP.md` patterns
    - **Testing Strategy Alignment:** All testing approaches must follow `docs/global-testing-strategy.md` guidelines
    - **Deviation Documentation:** Any required deviations must be documented with clear rationale
    - **Pattern Evolution:** Successful new patterns should be integrated into global documentation
    - **Deviation Verification:** The AI MUST obtain explicit user verification before deviating from global strategies, even if the AI believes the strategy is not applicable
- **Documentation Requirements:**
    - **Primary Location:** Must update `docs/global-testing-strategy.md` for global testing patterns and lessons learned
    - **Package-Specific Location:** Update `packages/{package}/__tests__/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` for package-specific deviations or unique testing requirements
    - **Update Triggers:** Any of the following scenarios require Testing Strategy updates:
        - Test failures that reveal mock setup issues
        - Mock library limitations discovered during testing
        - Console output or debugging challenges resolved
        - Test isolation problems solved
        - Mock configuration patterns that proved successful
        - New testing anti-patterns identified
        - Successful testing approaches that should be standardized
    - **Update Format:** Each update must include:
        - **Problem Description:** Clear explanation of what went wrong
        - **Root Cause Analysis:** Why the problem occurred
        - **Solution Applied:** Specific steps taken to fix the issue
        - **Best Practices:** Generalizable patterns for future use
        - **Mock Library Coverage:** What can/cannot be handled by mock libraries
    - **Section Organization:** Updates should be organized into logical sections:
        - Mock Setup & Configuration
        - Debugging & Troubleshooting
        - Library Limitations & Workarounds
        - Test Isolation & State Management
    - **Maintenance:** These documents serve as the authoritative reference for testing patterns and should be updated whenever new insights are gained

---

## **Phase 5: Final Report**

- **Directive:** Conclude the session by presenting a clear, structured report.
- **Report Structure:**
    1.  **Status of Doctrine:** A single line: `✅ Universal Operational Doctrine updated.` OR `✅ FocusedUX Operational Doctrine updated.` OR `ℹ️ No universal lessons were distilled; no updates required.`
    2.  **Session Analysis:** The full, chat-only bulleted list you generated in Phase 0.

---

## **Execution Trigger**

- **Command:** `retro` - Triggers full retrospective analysis
- **Scope:** Entire session review and learning integration
- **Output:** Structured learning report with doctrine updates
- **Integration:** Updates both Universal and FocusedUX doctrine files as appropriate
