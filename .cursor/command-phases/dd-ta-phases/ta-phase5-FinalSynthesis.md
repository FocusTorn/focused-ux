### **STEP 3: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY GENERATION**

**AI TASK**: Generate formatted executive summary for display

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FORMAT**:

The executive summary must follow this dynamic template format for display:

```markdown
# Test Structure Analysis - {Package Name}

## 1. :: Redundant and Non-Best-Practice Files

### 1.1. :: Type Definition Tests

Files to Remove:
{AI populates with specific files and test counts from analysis}

❌ Testing TypeScript Type Definitions: Type definitions are compile-time constructs, not runtime functionality
❌ No Actual Testing Value: These tests can't fail because they're testing TypeScript types, not behavior
❌ False Test Coverage: They inflate test counts without providing real value
❌ Maintenance Overhead: Changes to types require updating meaningless tests

### 1.2. :: Performance Tests (Inappropriate for Unit Tests)

Files to Remove:
{AI populates with specific files and line counts from analysis}

❌ Performance Testing in Unit Test Suite: Performance tests belong in separate test suites
❌ Environment-Dependent: Performance tests are unreliable in CI/CD environments
❌ Mock-Heavy: These tests are mostly mocks with minimal actual testing
❌ False Metrics: They provide misleading performance data

{AI adds additional anti-pattern categories as discovered:}

### 1.{N}. :: {Anti-Pattern Category Name}

Files to Remove:
{AI populates with specific files and metrics}

❌ {Anti-pattern reason 1}
❌ {Anti-pattern reason 2}

## 2. :: Missing Test Coverage for Critical Components

{AI dynamically generates based on analysis results:}

1. {Component/Functionality Name} Testing
    - Missing: {Specific missing test type}
    - Missing: {Specific missing test type}
    - Missing: {Specific missing test type}

2. {Component/Functionality Name} Testing
    - Missing: {Specific missing test type}
    - Missing: {Specific missing test type}

{N. {Additional components as discovered}}

## 3. :: PRIORITY MATRIX

### 3.1. Immediate Action Required

{AI dynamically generates based on priority analysis:}

1. {Priority Item Name}
    - Target: {Specific target from analysis}
    - Gap: {Specific gap description from analysis}
    - Impact: {Impact assessment from analysis}

2. {Priority Item Name}
    - Target: {Specific target from analysis}
    - Gap: {Specific gap description from analysis}
    - Impact: {Impact assessment from analysis}

{N. {Additional priority items as identified}}

### 3.2. Future Improvements

{AI dynamically generates based on analysis results:}

1. {Future Improvement Name}
    - Target: {Specific target from analysis}
    - Gap: {Specific gap description from analysis}
    - Impact: {Impact assessment from analysis}

2. {Future Improvement Name}
    - Target: {Specific target from analysis}
    - Gap: {Specific gap description from analysis}
    - Impact: {Impact assessment from analysis}

{N. {Additional future improvements as identified}}
```

### **STEP 4: CONTENT POPULATION**

**AI TASK**: Populate executive summary with actual analysis results

**CONTENT POPULATION PROCESS**:

1. **Dynamic Content Extraction**: Extract all relevant data from previous phases
2. **Dynamic Section Generation**: Generate sections based on actual analysis results
3. **Dynamic Category Creation**: Create anti-pattern categories as discovered
4. **Dynamic Priority Generation**: Generate priority items based on analysis findings
5. **Dynamic Component Mapping**: Map missing coverage to actual components found

**DYNAMIC CONTENT REQUIREMENTS**:

- **Package Name**: Use actual package name in title
- **Dynamic Anti-Pattern Categories**: Generate categories based on discovered anti-patterns
- **Dynamic File Lists**: Populate with actual files found in analysis
- **Dynamic Gap Descriptions**: Use actual gap descriptions from analysis
- **Dynamic Priority Items**: Generate priority items based on actual analysis results
- **Dynamic Component Lists**: Generate component lists based on actual functionality found
- **Flexible Structure**: Adapt structure based on what was actually discovered

### **STEP 5: FINAL VALIDATION**

**AI TASK**: Validate final output and executive summary

**VALIDATION PROCESS**:

1. **Comprehensive Document Validation**: Ensure complete analysis document is generated
2. **Executive Summary Validation**: Ensure executive summary follows exact format
3. **Content Accuracy Validation**: Ensure all content is accurate and complete
4. **Formatting Validation**: Ensure proper formatting and structure
5. **Completeness Validation**: Ensure all required elements are present

**VALIDATION CRITERIA**:

- All phase results are included in final document
- Executive summary follows exact template format
- All specific files, gaps, and targets are accurately listed
- All formatting requirements are met
- No placeholder content remains in final output

### **STEP 6: OUTPUT DISPLAY**

**AI TASK**: Display executive summary and confirm file generation

**DISPLAY PROCESS**:

1. **Confirm File Generation**: Confirm comprehensive document was created
