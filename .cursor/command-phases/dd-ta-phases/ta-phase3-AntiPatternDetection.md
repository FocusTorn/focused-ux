## **COMMAND PURPOSE**

**Primary Objective**: Identify and catalog anti-pattern test files and non-best-practice testing approaches
**Scope**: Anti-pattern detection, redundant file identification, best practice violations
**Output**: Comprehensive anti-pattern analysis with specific files to remove or refactor

## **EXECUTION PROTOCOL**

### **STEP 1: TYPE DEFINITION TEST IDENTIFICATION**

**AI TASK**: Identify tests that only test TypeScript types/interfaces

**CRITICAL IDENTIFICATION CRITERIA**:

- Tests that only validate TypeScript type definitions
- Tests that check interface compliance without behavior
- Tests that validate type exports and imports
- Tests that check type-only constructs

**ANTI-PATTERN CHARACTERISTICS**:

- ❌ **Testing TypeScript Type Definitions**: Type definitions are compile-time constructs, not runtime functionality
- ❌ **No Actual Testing Value**: These tests can't fail because they're testing TypeScript types, not behavior
- ❌ **False Test Coverage**: They inflate test counts without providing real value
- ❌ **Maintenance Overhead**: Changes to types require updating meaningless tests

**FILES TO IDENTIFY**:

- `*Types.test.ts` files
- `*Interfaces.test.ts` files
- Tests that only validate type exports
- Tests that check interface definitions
- Tests that validate type-only imports

### **STEP 2: PERFORMANCE TEST IDENTIFICATION**

**AI TASK**: Identify inappropriate performance tests in unit test suites

**CRITICAL IDENTIFICATION CRITERIA**:

- Performance tests mixed with unit tests
- Environment-dependent performance tests
- Mock-heavy performance tests
- Tests that measure execution time in unit test suite

**ANTI-PATTERN CHARACTERISTICS**:

- ❌ **Performance Testing in Unit Test Suite**: Performance tests belong in separate test suites
- ❌ **Environment-Dependent**: Performance tests are unreliable in CI/CD environments
- ❌ **Mock-Heavy**: These tests are mostly mocks with minimal actual testing
- ❌ **False Metrics**: They provide misleading performance data

**FILES TO IDENTIFY**:

- `*.p.test-noop.ts` files
- `*performance*.test.ts` files
- Tests with performance measurement in unit suite
- Bundle size tests in unit test suite
- Memory usage tests in unit test suite
- Startup time tests in unit test suite

### **STEP 3: REDUNDANT TEST IDENTIFICATION**

**AI TASK**: Identify duplicate or overlapping test functionality

**CRITICAL IDENTIFICATION CRITERIA**:

- Tests that duplicate functionality already tested elsewhere
- Tests that test the same functionality multiple times
- Tests with identical or nearly identical test logic
- Tests that provide no additional coverage value

**REDUNDANCY PATTERNS**:

- **Duplicate Functionality**: Same functionality tested in multiple files
- **Overlapping Coverage**: Tests that cover the same code paths
- **Identical Test Logic**: Tests with identical implementation
- **No Additional Value**: Tests that don't increase coverage or confidence

**IDENTIFICATION METHODS**:

- Compare test descriptions and implementations
- Analyze test coverage overlap
- Identify identical test patterns
- Assess unique value of each test

### **STEP 4: NON-BEST-PRACTICE IDENTIFICATION**

**AI TASK**: Identify tests that violate testing best practices

**CRITICAL IDENTIFICATION CRITERIA**:

- Tests that violate established testing patterns
- Tests that don't follow naming conventions
- Tests that have poor organization or structure
- Tests that use inappropriate testing approaches

**BEST PRACTICE VIOLATIONS**:

- **Naming Convention Violations**: Tests that don't follow established naming patterns
- **Organization Violations**: Tests that are poorly organized or structured
- **Testing Approach Violations**: Tests that use inappropriate testing methodologies
- **Mock Strategy Violations**: Tests that violate established mock patterns
- **Documentation Violations**: Tests that lack proper documentation or comments

**VIOLATION CATEGORIES**:

- File naming and organization violations
- Test structure and organization violations
- Mock strategy and setup violations
- Documentation and comment violations
- Testing methodology violations

### **STEP 5: MISNAMED TEST IDENTIFICATION**

**AI TASK**: Identify tests with incorrect names or references

**CRITICAL IDENTIFICATION CRITERIA**:

- Tests that reference wrong packages or components
- Tests with misleading or incorrect names
- Tests that don't match their actual functionality
- Tests that reference non-existent functionality

**MISNAMING PATTERNS**:

- **Wrong Package References**: Tests that reference incorrect packages
- **Misleading Names**: Test names that don't describe actual functionality
- **Functionality Mismatch**: Tests that test different functionality than described
- **Reference Errors**: Tests that reference non-existent code or functionality

**IDENTIFICATION METHODS**:

- Compare test names to actual test content
- Verify package references in test files
- Check functionality descriptions against implementations
- Validate test descriptions against test logic

### **STEP 6: COVERAGE TEST ANTI-PATTERN IDENTIFICATION**

**AI TASK**: Identify meaningless or ineffective coverage tests

**CRITICAL IDENTIFICATION CRITERIA**:

- Tests that don't actually improve code coverage
- Tests that test undefined or null scenarios without value
- Tests that are purely for coverage metrics without validation
- Tests that provide no meaningful coverage

**ANTI-PATTERN CHARACTERISTICS**:

- ❌ **Meaningless Tests**: Tests that don't provide actual testing value
- ❌ **Coverage Gaming**: Tests designed only to increase coverage metrics
- ❌ **No Validation**: Tests that don't validate actual functionality
- ❌ **False Coverage**: Tests that appear to cover code but don't test behavior

**IDENTIFICATION METHODS**:

- Analyze test content for meaningful assertions
- Check if tests validate actual behavior
- Assess coverage impact of individual tests
- Identify tests that only test edge cases without value

### **STEP 7: OUTPUT GENERATION AND STORAGE**

**AI TASK**: Generate structured anti-pattern analysis and append to staging document

**OUTPUT PROCESS**:

1. **Generate Phase 3 Output**: Create comprehensive anti-pattern analysis
2. **Write to Staging File**: Append to **STAGING_FILE**
3. **Validate Output Completeness**: Ensure all anti-pattern categories are covered
4. **Prepare for Next Phase**: Mark phase as complete and ready for Phase 4
