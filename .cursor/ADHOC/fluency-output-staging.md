    // Delegates to specialized services
    async runNx(argv: string[]): Promise<number> {
        return this.dependencies.commandExecution.runNx(argv)
    }

    generateLocalFiles(): void {
        return this.dependencies.aliasManager.generateLocalFiles()
    }
}
```

    expandableProcessor,
    commandExecution,
    aliasManager,
}

export const paeManager = new PAEManagerService(defaultDependencies)

}
```

```typescript
export const config: AliasConfig = {
    nxTargets: {
        b: 'build',
        t: 'test',
        l: 'lint',
    },
    'expandable-flags': {
        f: '--fix',
        s: '--skip-nx-cache',
    },
}
```

- **Error Handling**:

```typescript
function gracefulShutdown(exitCode: number) {
    if (isExiting) {
        debug('Already shutting down, forcing exit')
        process.exit(exitCode)
    }

    isExiting = true
    debug('Initiating graceful shutdown, cleaning up resources')

    // Kill any active child processes
    for (const childProcess of activeProcesses) {
        try {
            if (childProcess && !childProcess.killed) {
                childProcess.kill('SIGTERM')
            }
        } catch (err) {
            debug('Error killing child process:', err)
        }
    }
}
```
