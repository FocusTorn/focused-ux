### Outline

- **npm-check-updates Configuration**:
    - **@types/vscode Version Locking**:
        - User asked about locking @types/vscode to version 1.99.3 in ncu
        - Discovered @types/vscode@1.99.3 doesn't exist (latest is 1.93.0)
        - Created .ncurc.json configuration file to reject @types/vscode
          updates
    - **VSCode Engine Compatibility**:
        - User asked about maximum VSCode engine version Cursor allows
        - Found Cursor supports up to VSCode engine 1.93.1 (as of Dec 2024)
        - Explained version mismatch between engine requirement and
          available types
    - **Current Status**:
        - .ncurc.json created to prevent @types/vscode updates
        - Root package.json already had pnpm.overrides for @types/vscode:
          1.99.3

- **pnpm Workspace Dependency Resolution**:
    - **Error Investigation**:
        - User encountered 404 error for @fux/vscode-test-cli-config during
          pnpm install
        - Identified missing workspace protocol in dependency declaration
    - **Solution Implementation**:
        - Updated plugins/vscode-test-executor/package.json to use
          "workspace:\*" protocol
        - Fixed dependency resolution for local workspace packages

- **PowerShell Module Development**:
    - **Robocopy Integration**:
        - User asked about running robocopy from PowerShell
        - Provided examples and syntax for robocopy commands
    - **Batch Script Conversion**:
        - User wanted to convert batch script for pnpm reset to PowerShell
        - Created PowerShell equivalent with robocopy for fast node_modules
          deletion
    - **Module Creation**:
        - User requested executable function named "reset-pnpm-deps"
        - Created complete PowerShell module with multiple functions
        - Established proper file structure and naming conventions
    - **File Organization**:
        - User specified module folder should be "\_reset-pnpm-deps" but
          files without underscores
        - Created files in \_scripts/ps/ directory structure
        - Final structure: C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\_
          reset-pnpm-deps\ with reset-pnpm-deps.psm1/psd1
