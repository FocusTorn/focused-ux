# Workspace Rules Compliance - Extracted Information

## Overview

This document contains all information relating to Workspace Rules Compliance from the conversation summary.

## Rule Enforcement Issues

- **Identified AI skipping mandatory workspace rules**
- **Analyzed Cursor documentation for rule compliance**
- **Modified Guidelines-FocusedUX(workspace).mdc for enforcement**

## Rule Modifications

- **Added CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT NOTICE**
- **Converted guidelines to mandatory directives**
- **Removed Status Indicator Protocol and Build-Before-Test**
- **Added validation checklist framework**

## Current Status

- **Rules now enforce mandatory compliance**
- **AI behavior improved with directive language**

## Detailed Context

### Problem Identification

The user identified that the AI was consistently skipping portions of the rule set despite them being marked as "Always Applied." The user requested a review of the Cursor documentation to understand why this was happening and then to modify the `@Guidelines-FocusedUX(workspace).mdc` file to enforce mandatory compliance.

### Solution Implementation

The `@Guidelines-FocusedUX(workspace).mdc` file was extensively modified to transform it from a set of guidelines into mandatory directives:

1. **Added "CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT NOTICE"** at the top
2. **All key actions were prefixed with "MANDATORY:"**
3. **Converted conditional language to imperative directives**
4. **Removed "Status Indicator Protocol" and "Build-Before-Test Compliance"** based on user feedback
5. **Added "CRITICAL PRE-RESPONSE VALIDATION FRAMEWORK"** with mandatory execution checklist

### Key Changes Made

- **MANDATORY**: Check docs/ first before creating solutions
- **MANDATORY**: Reference existing patterns directly in responses
- **MANDATORY**: Execute documented solutions without additional analysis
- **MANDATORY**: Prevent violations by never creating solutions when documentation exists
- **MANDATORY**: Testing Strategy - ALWAYS check `docs/FocusedUX-Testing-Strategy.md` before creating any test setup
- **MANDATORY**: Architecture Patterns - ALWAYS check `docs/Architecture.md` before creating any package structure

### Enforcement Framework

Added a "CRITICAL PRE-RESPONSE VALIDATION FRAMEWORK" with mandatory execution checklist:

**STEP 1: PAE ALIAS COMPLIANCE**

- [ ] **Alias Discovery**: Will I attempt `pae help` first to discover available aliases?
- [ ] **Alias Usage**: Will I use appropriate alias for the operation (e.g., `pae dc b` for dynamicons build)?
- [ ] **Fallback Protocol**: Will I only use direct nx commands if no alias exists or alias fails?
- [ ] **Documentation**: Will I document any missing aliases that should be added to PAE system?

**STEP 2: BUILD ERROR RESOLUTION**

- [ ] **Error Resolution**: Will I fix build errors immediately before proceeding?
- [ ] **Cache Bypass**: Will I use `--skip-nx-cache` for troubleshooting when needed?

**STEP 3: DOCUMENTATION FIRST COMPLIANCE**

- [ ] **Architecture Check**: Have I checked `docs/Architecture.md` for package structure and patterns?
- [ ] **Testing Check**: Have I checked `docs/FocusedUX-Testing-Strategy.md` for testing patterns?
- [ ] **Previous Solutions**: Have I checked `./docs/Actions-Log.md` for existing implementations?

**STEP 4: PACKAGE ANALYSIS COMPLIANCE**

- [ ] **Project Details**: Will I use `nx_project_details` to understand package dependencies?
- [ ] **Architectural Deviations**: Will I check for deviations from standard patterns?
- [ ] **Package Type Verification**: Will I verify package type (core vs ext vs shared vs tool) and role?

**STEP 5: SELF-CORRECTION**

- [ ] **Violation Detection**: If I detect any protocol violation, will I acknowledge immediately?

### Violation Prevention

Added natural stops and pattern recognition:

- **MANDATORY**: Business logic in extensions → "This belongs in core"
- **MANDATORY**: VSCode value imports → "Use type imports only"
- **MANDATORY**: Direct nx commands → "Use PAE aliases"
- **MANDATORY**: Test failures → "Check if build is clean first"
- **MANDATORY**: Documentation questions → "Check docs/ before creating"
- **MANDATORY**: Package confusion → "Check package type and path"
- **MANDATORY**: Creating solutions without checking docs → "STOP! Check docs/ first - this is a critical violation"
- **MANDATORY**: Creating test setups without checking testing strategy → "STOP! Check docs/FocusedUX-Testing-Strategy.md first - this is a critical violation"

### Result

The rules are now structured as mandatory directives rather than suggestions, with clear enforcement mechanisms and violation penalties. This ensures consistent compliance with workspace guidelines and prevents the AI from skipping critical steps.
