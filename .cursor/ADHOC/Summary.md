# Conversation Summary - High Level

## Topics Discussed

### Outline

- **Workspace Performance Audit**:
    - **Initial Analysis**:
        - Performance audit of FocusedUX workspace
        - Identified build dependency bottlenecks
        - Created prioritized action items (high/medium/low impact)
    - **Build Optimization**:
        - Fixed note-hub-core build errors
        - Optimized Nx target dependencies
        - Separated PAE script generation for better caching
    - **Current Status**:
        - Performance audit completed with action plan

- **PAE (Project Alias Expander) Testing Issues**:
    - **Mock Strategy Dependencies**:
        - Identified PAE as only package using @fux/mock-strategy
        - Fixed missing exports in mock-strategy package
        - Resolved dependency issues causing unnecessary builds
    - **CLI Architecture Refinement**:
        - Fixed CLI help output when run without arguments
        - Implemented three-part architecture (local generation, system install, help)
        - Added install alias for install-aliases command
    - **Test Optimization**:
        - Implemented comprehensive mocking to prevent real command execution
        - Fixed test caching issues
        - Achieved 100% codebase functionality coverage
    - **Current Status**:
        - All PAE tests passing and optimized

- **Mock Strategy Documentation**:
    - **Comprehensive Guidelines**:
        - Created Mock-Strategy_General.md with 4-tier hierarchy
        - Documented scenarios vs standard mocks decision matrix
        - Added troubleshooting guide and best practices
    - **Critical Anti-Patterns**:
        - Added CRITICAL warning against simplifying mocks to make tests pass
        - Documented proper mock complexity requirements
        - Established "fix the mock, not the test" principle
    - **Current Status**:
        - Complete mock strategy documentation with troubleshooting

### Chronological (With Concise Topic Points)

- **Workspace Performance Audit**: Systematic analysis and optimization of build dependencies
- **PAE Testing Issues**: Mock strategy dependencies and CLI architecture problems
- **CLI Refinement**: Fixed help output, implemented proper architecture
- **Test Optimization**: Comprehensive mocking and 100% coverage achievement
- **Mock Strategy Documentation**: Complete guidelines with critical anti-patterns
